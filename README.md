# Motivation

Every application needs Authentication and at some point Authorization, implementing this in each project can be tedious and time consuming. `No Auth` solves this problem for you so, you can focus on other important tasks.

### How to use?

- Clone the repo
- Add env variables, refer env.example
- Goto Root of the frontend in browser example:- localhost:3000
- There is a link to `Go to Single Sign On`, click on it to land on single sign on page
- Verify email and create account or login
- Create new organization
- Open organization page and create sso page from authentication section
- Next go to env tab where you will get all envs for your frontend and backend
- Now, add `@no-auth/next` package, go thru the instructions.
- There is SSO_URL in the frontend env, you can redirect users to that link for login or sign ups, on every new signups system will send user generater `{uuid, email}` to the webhook link(your backend).
- No auth is not managing users yet, so you need to manually store user into your system and all done.
- here 3000 post is used for nextjs frontend and 3001 used for nestjs backend. changing this will need update env as well.
